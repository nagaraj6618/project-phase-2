# Smart Grammer Correction Engine with Speech Recognition

## About
Smart Grammar Correction Engine with Speech Recognition is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance language proficiency by providing real-time feedback on both written and spoken communication. It aims to support students in resource-limited settings, where language barriers often hinder academic and career growth. Leveraging advanced NLP and deep learning techniques, the system detects and corrects grammatical errors, refines pronunciation, and improves speech patterns. Key features such as secure login with two-factor authentication, chat history tracking, personalized learning insights, and seamless account management ensure a user-friendly experience. By offering accessible, high-quality language instruction, this tool empowers users to develop strong communication skills, boosting their confidence and future opportunities.


## Methodology

This project employs an AI-driven approach combining speech-to-text conversion, grammar correction, and adaptive learning to enhance students' communication skills.

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**  
  - Uses an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model to transcribe spoken input into text.  
  - Ensures accurate representation of studentsâ€™ speech.  

- **Grammar and Pronunciation Analysis**  
  - A rule-based and deep learning-based grammar-checking system.  
  - Identifies grammatical errors, assesses pronunciation, and evaluates sentence fluency.  

- **Feedback Generation**  
  - Provides real-time corrections, fluency scores, and pronunciation suggestions.  
  - Helps students refine their communication.  

- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism**  
  - Personalized feedback loop encourages students to practice corrected sentences aloud.  
  - Reinforces learning through repetition and gradual improvement.  

- **User Interaction and Data Tracking**  
  - Features include chat history, performance tracking, and analytics.  
  - Helps students monitor their progress over time.
