## Methodology

This project employs an AI-driven approach combining speech-to-text conversion, grammar correction, and adaptive learning to enhance students' communication skills.

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**  
  - Uses an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model to transcribe spoken input into text.  
  - Ensures accurate representation of students’ speech.  

- **Grammar and Pronunciation Analysis**  
  - A rule-based and deep learning-based grammar-checking system.  
  - Identifies grammatical errors, assesses pronunciation, and evaluates sentence fluency.  

- **Feedback Generation**  
  - Provides real-time corrections, fluency scores, and pronunciation suggestions.  
  - Helps students refine their communication.  

- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism**  
  - Personalized feedback loop encourages students to practice corrected sentences aloud.  
  - Reinforces learning through repetition and gradual improvement.  

- **User Interaction and Data Tracking**  
  - Features include chat history, performance tracking, and analytics.  
  - Helps students monitor their progress over time.
