## Methodology:
This project employs an AI-driven approach combining speech-to-text conversion, grammar correction, and adaptive learning to enhance students' communication skills.
Speech-to-Text Conversion – The system uses an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model to transcribe spoken input into text, ensuring accurate representation of students’ speech.
Grammar and Pronunciation Analysis – A rule-based and deep learning-based grammar-checking system identifies grammatical errors, assesses pronunciation, and evaluates sentence fluency.
Feedback Generation – The system provides real-time corrections, fluency scores, and pronunciation suggestions to help students refine their communication.
Adaptive Learning Mechanism – A personalized feedback loop encourages students to practice corrected sentences aloud, reinforcing learning through repetition and gradual improvement.
User Interaction and Data Tracking – Features like chat history, performance tracking, and analytics help students monitor their progress over time.
